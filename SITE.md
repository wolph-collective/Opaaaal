# Project Vision & Constitution

> **AGENT INSTRUCTION:** Read this file before every iteration. It serves as the project's "Long-Term Memory." If `next-prompt.md` is empty, pick the highest priority item from Section 5 OR invent a new page that fits the project vision.

## 1. Core Identity
* **Project Name:** Opal – Focus & Digital Wellbeing
* **Stitch Project ID:** `6085766964879835609`
* **Mission:** Offer a sanctuary for deep work and digital wellbeing, helping users regain control over their screen time.
* **Target Audience:** Knowledge workers, students, and anyone seeking to reduce digital distraction.
* **Voice:** Calm, Encouraging, Premium, Scientific, Minimalist.

## 2. Visual Language (Stitch Prompt Strategy)
*Strictly adhere to these descriptive rules when prompting Stitch. Do NOT use code.*

* **The "Vibe" (Adjectives):**
    * *Primary:* **Calm** (Serene, peaceful, safe).
    * *Secondary:* **Premium** (High-quality, refined, elegant).
    * *Tertiary:* **Focus-Oriented** (Clear, undistracted, essential).

* **Color Philosophy (Semantic):**
    * **Backgrounds:** Deep Black (#040404) or Very Dark Gray. The "void" that allows focus.
    * **Accents:** Electric Mint Green (#ADFFA6) for success/action, Melrose Purple (#B0A8FE) for calm/wisdom.
    * **Text:** White (#FFFFFF) for primary legibility, Soft Gray for secondary.

## 3. Architecture & File Structure
* **Root:** `site/public/`
* **Asset Flow:** Stitch generates to `queue/` -> Validate -> Move to `site/public/`.
* **Mobile-First:** All designs must be optimized for mobile screens first.

## 4. Live Sitemap (Current State)
*The Agent MUST update this section when a new page is successfully merged.*

* [x] `plan-selection.html` - Choose a subscription plan.
* [x] `focus-config.html` - Configure a focus session.
* [x] `checkout.html` - Payment and confirmation.

## 5. The Roadmap (Backlog)
*If `next-prompt.md` is empty or completed, pick the next task from here.*

### High Priority
- [ ] **Plan Selection:** Compare Free vs Pro plans with elegant cards.
- [ ] **Focus Configuration:** Timer setup, app blocking list, difficulty level.
- [ ] **Checkout:** Secure, trustworthy, minimal payment flow.

## 6. Creative Freedom Guidelines
*When the backlog is empty, follow these guidelines to innovate.*

1. **Stay On-Brand:** Dark mode default. Use the gem (Opal) metaphor where appropriate.
2. **Enhance the Core:** Focus on the "Time Saved" metric.
3. **Naming Convention:** Use lowercase, descriptive filenames.
